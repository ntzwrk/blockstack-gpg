# blockstack-gpg
###### *the python version*

This is a legacy project and isn't maintained. For the old code, see the [`legacy`](https://github.com/ntzwrk/blockstack-gpg.py/tree/legacy) branch (this code may work for an old version of [`blockstack-core`](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-core)).

The way to support working with verified keys is to implement it in the corresponding library that handles proofs.
You can track the status for JavaScript [here](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack.js/issues/297); the Python equivalent would be implemented in a future Python version of [`blockstack.js`](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack.js).
